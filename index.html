<h1> Playing it Straight </h1>
<p> <!--Placeholder only --> When English Premier League footballer Justin Fashanu came out as gay in 1990, his story attracted attention around the world. Fashanu's sensational discloure, it was believed, would be the first in a long line of revelations made by professional sports stars. As is well known, however, Fashanu's story ended in tragedy in 1998 when the 37-year-old killed himself following an allegation of sexual assault. It has now become the ultimate question for LGBT sports fans, asked every year in newspaper columns and discussed in pubs on match days: why, in the 27 years since Fashanu first came out, does he remain the only UK professional footballer to do so? (In the men's league at least - as is often forgotten, plenty of women footballers are openly LGBT). But it is not just football which has a dearth of openly LGBT players, and it is not just the UK that has this problem. Sports fans around the world are starting to wake up to a cruel fact, that sport remains one of the last safe vestiges for homophobia and sexual secrecy. We have, for the first time, collated the number of openly LGBT players in every major professional sport.
